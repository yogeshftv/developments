### External CSS
- It involves storing in separate CSS files. It can be efficient for global styles or styles shared across many components. However, it can lead to class name conflicts in complex applications.

### Inline CSS
- You can define styles directly within your JSX using the style attribute. This approach can be useful for quick styling or making styles specific to a single element, but it can make code cluttered and harder to maintain.

### Modules
- This is generally considered the best approach for styling components in React, especially for complex applications. It offers several advantages:
    a. Reduced Class Name Conflicts: CSS Modules automatically generate unique class names for your component's styles using hashing algorithms, preventing conflicts with styles from other components.
    b. Improved Organization: Styles are located alongside the component they apply to, making code cleaner and easier to understand.
