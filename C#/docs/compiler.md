- A special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different format that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute.

### But why does code need to be compiled? 
Although most programming languages seem cryptic at first, they can be more easily understood by humans than the computer's preferred language. The CPU understands instructions that are expressed by turning thousands or millions of tiny switches either on or off. Compilers bridge these two worlds by translating your human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.
